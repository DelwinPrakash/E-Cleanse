    "Hey there! 👋 Ever wondered what happens to your old phone, laptop, or that ancient gaming console you’ve been hoarding?",
    "Spoiler alert: they don’t just disappear. In fact, they end up as e-waste, and it’s a BIG problem.",
    "But don’t worry, we’ve got your back! Instead of letting your gadgets collect dust (or worse, end up in a landfill), why not recycle them the right way? By doing so, you’re not just decluttering your space—you’re helping save the planet. 🌱",
    // "Here’s the deal: e-waste is packed with valuable stuff like gold, silver, and copper. Yep, your old phone is basically a tiny treasure chest! 🏴‍☠️ When you recycle, we extract these materials and reuse them, so we don’t have to mine more from the Earth. Cool, right?",
    "So, what are you waiting for? Dig out those old gadgets, click the button below, and let’s give them a second life. Together, we can make a difference—one recycled device at a time. 💪"
